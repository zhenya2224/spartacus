# Spartacus Core Library

The Spartacus Core Library provides core Spartacus features, which are a required building block for other Spartacus libraries.

To quickly add Spartacus libraries to an Angular application, you can use Spartacus schematics: `ng add @spartacus/schematics`. This will setup and install Spartacus libraries to your Angular project. Please check the [official Spartacus schematics documentation](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/) for all the prerequisites and instruction on how to use Spartacus schematics.
